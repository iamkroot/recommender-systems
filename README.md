# Recommender Systems

Implementation and comparision of various techniques of building recommender systems, such as:
* Collaborative Filtering
* SVD (Using Dense Matrices)
* CUR (Using Sparse Matrices)
* Latent Factor Model - SVD using Gradient Descent

## Dataset
We use the [Movielens 1M](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/) movie ratings dataset to train and test the various models. The datasets contain around 1 million anonymous ratings of approximately 3,900 movies made by 6,000 MovieLens users who joined MovieLens in 2000.
